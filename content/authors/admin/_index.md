### About Me
Hi! I'm Yiwei, a final-year master student at [EPFL Digital Humanities](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/research-2/dhi/), previously obtaining my Bachelor degree in Statistics from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).

I'm passionate about understanding how artificial intelligence systems work, with the goal of building safe AI that truly aligns with human values and behaviors. To achieve this, my work focus on leveraging insights from human behavior and cognitive abilities‚Äîsuch as social reasoning, psychology, and linguistics‚Äîto evaluate and align large language models.

Currently, I'm working with [Thibault Laugel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GAKJBJYAAAAJ&hl=en) at [AXA GO Research](https://axa-rev-research.github.io/) exploring test-time intervention methods for LLM alignment. During my exchange at [NII, Tokyo](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), I worked with Prof. [Saku Sugawara](https://penzant.net/) on evaluating LLMs' Theory of Mind reasoning in white lie understanding. Previously, at [IVIA lab, ETH Z√ºrich](https://ivia.ethz.ch/) with [Robin Chan](https://chanr0.github.io/), under the supervision of Prof. [Mennatallah El-Assady](https://el-assady.com/) and Prof. [Fr√©d√©ric Kaplan](https://people.epfl.ch/frederic.kaplan?lang=en), I was trying to understand better LLMs and human's handling of ambiguity.

Outside research, I enjoy tennisüéæ, bakingüç∞ and photographyüì∑. You can see some of moments captured through my lens: [1](/uploads/photo1.JPG), [2](/uploads/photo2.JPG), [3](/uploads/photo3.JPG).

<div class="info-box">
<span class="info-icon">üì¢</span>Feel free to reach out! I'm currently looking for a <strong>master's thesis opportunity starting March 2026</strong> and <strong>PhD positions starting in Fall 2026</strong>. I'd love to connect if you think there's a good match!
