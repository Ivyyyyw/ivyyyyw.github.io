### About Me

Hi! I'm Yiwei, a final-year master student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/research-2/dhi/).
Previously I obtained my Bachelor degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/) in Statistics.


My main research interest lies in LLMs evaluation and alignment. My motivation comes from I want to augument AI with human's coginition tools and reasonning ability. Because I want to build LLMs with cognition ability not just math.


Currently I'm working with [Thibault Laugel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GAKJBJYAAAAJ&hl=en) at AXA exploring knowlegde editing methods for LLMs alligbment. Before, during my exchange semester in [NII, Tokyo](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), I worked with Prof. [Saku Sugawara](https://penzant.net/) on LLMs Theory of Mind ability evaluation. And I also had the pleasure of working as a research student at [IVIA lab](https://ivia.ethz.ch/) [@ETH Z√ºrich](https://ethz.ch/en.html)  with [Robin Chan](https://chanr0.github.io/), under the supervision of Prof. [Mennatallah El-Assady](https://el-assady.com/) and Prof. [Fr√©d√©ric Kaplan](https://people.epfl.ch/frederic.kaplan?lang=en), where I was trying to understand better of ambiguity understanding of LLMs and I exploed visualization of syntactic Ambiguity understanding from linguistics and HCI perspective.

Outside research, I enjoy tennisüéæ, bakingüç∞ and photographyüì∑. You can see some of moments captured through my lens: [1](/uploads/photo1.jpg), [2](/uploads/photo2.jpg), [3](/uploads/photo3.jpg), [4](/uploads/photo7.jpg), [5](/uploads/photo5.jpg).


Feel free to reach out to me: I'm currently searching for thesis chance start from March 2026 and PhD position start from nexr Autumn, please let me know if there's match, I'm looking for more chances and potential collaboration!
